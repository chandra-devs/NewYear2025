# Running Steps

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
   - Minimum version required: Python 3.6+
   - To check your Python version, run: `python --version`

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/PythonProjects
   ```

## Running the Project
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if requirements.txt exists):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any permission issues, try running the commands with administrator privileges
- Make sure all required dependencies are installed
- Check if Python is added to your system's PATH
